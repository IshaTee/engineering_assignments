# Assignment for Frontend Developer. 

Soko is an omnichannel commerce platform that enables micro and small businesses across emerging markets to quickly set up and run an online retail store.

A typical seller installs the Soko Merchant app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soko.sokomerchant), signs up using his mobile number and creates his store.
